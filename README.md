# Survey Form
 FreeCodeCamp challenge Survey Form.


HTML:

- Created a html form using HTML5 latest features and the BEM system to name classes.

- Learned how the id's and name's work together between label and inputs.

- Included types: text, email, number, dropdown, radio, checkbox, textarea and submit tags and learned how they work

CSS / SASS:

- In this project I used the root just for colors, designed the page basically with flexbox and feeling already confident with it.
